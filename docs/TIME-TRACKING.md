# Time Tracking

**Purpose:** Track actual time spent to improve estimates and understand velocity.

## Task Sizing Framework

| Size | Duration | Use For |
|------|----------|---------|
| üü¢ **Small** | < 10 min | Quick fixes, single file changes |
| üü° **Medium** | 10-45 min | Component updates, bug fixes |
| üü† **Large** | 45-90 min | Full features, integrations |
| üî¥ **X-Large** | > 90 min | Major features, architecture changes |

## Velocity (AI-Assisted Development)

**Your speed with AI assistance:**

| Task Type | Multiplier | Notes |
|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Coding** | 4x faster | AI writes most code |
| **Testing** | 1.3x faster | Still need manual verification |
| **Integration** | 2x faster | AI helps, you test |
| **Documentation** | 3x faster | AI drafts, you refine |

**Key Insight:** With AI, focus estimates on testing and integration, not coding.

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Error Handling & Observability

**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Size** | üü† Large |
| **Estimated** | 3.3 hours (raw) |
| **Actual** | **0.75 hours** |
| **Variance** | -2.55 hours (4.4x faster!) |
| **Cost (@$50/hr)** | $37.50 |

**What was delivered:**
- Error logs database table
- Logger utility
- Error boundaries
- Health check endpoint
- Automatic token refresh
- Comprehensive documentation

**Time breakdown:**
- Testing: ~25 min
- File operations: ~10 min
- Documentation review: ~5 min
- Troubleshooting: ~5 min

**Why so fast?**
- AI wrote 100% of code upfront
- Clear step-by-step instructions
- Pre-tested SQL migrations
- Good error messages

**Lessons:**
- Testing always takes time (can't skip!)
- AI coding time is nearly zero
- File operations on Mac need buffer
- OAuth flows need extra time

### Workflow Setup

**Date:** October 30, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Size** | üü° Medium |
| **Actual** | ~1 hour |
| **Cost (@$50/hr)** | $50 |

**What was delivered:**
- Feature branch workflow
- Preview deployment process
- Pull request template
- Consolidated documentation
- Cleaned up duplicate Vercel project

**Lessons:**
- Process setup is worth the time
- Good workflow pays dividends
- Documentation cleanup important

## ROI Analysis

### Phase 1 Investment

**Cost:** $37.50 (0.75 hours)  
**Monthly Benefits:**
- Faster debugging: 2 hours/week = 8 hours/month
- Fewer production issues: 1 hour/week = 4 hours/month
- Better monitoring: 30 min/week = 2 hours/month
- **Total: 14 hours/month saved**

**Monthly Value:** 14 hours √ó $50 = **$700/month**  
**Payback Period:** 1.6 days  
**Annual ROI:** 22,300%

## Session Template

### Planning a Session

**Before starting:**
1. Review ROADMAP.md for priorities
2. Choose tasks matching available time
3. Add 20% buffer for unknowns

**Example (2 hours available):**
- 1 Large task (~90 min + buffer)
- OR 2-3 Medium tasks (~40 min each + buffer)
- OR 4-5 Small tasks (~15 min each + buffer)

### During Session

**Track:**
- Start time
- Actual time per task
- Blockers/issues
- What went well
- What took longer than expected

### After Session

**Record:**
- Total time spent
- Tasks completed
- Estimate accuracy
- Key learnings

## Estimation Tips

### With AI Assistance

1. **Coding:** Reduce by 70-80% (AI writes)
2. **Testing:** Reduce by 20-30% (still manual)
3. **File operations:** Keep same (manual)
4. **Integration:** Reduce by 40-50% (AI helps)
5. **Documentation:** Reduce by 60-70% (AI drafts)

### Red Flags (Add Time)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è OAuth/auth flows (+20%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è External API integration (+30%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è First time doing something (+50%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Production deployment (+20%)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple dependencies (+30%)

### Green Flags (Reduce Time)

- ‚úÖ Similar to past work (-20%)
- ‚úÖ Clear requirements (-10%)
- ‚úÖ Good documentation (-20%)
- ‚úÖ AI can write code (-70%)
- ‚úÖ Simple test cases (-10%)
