# Life Dashboard - Time Tracking Log

## Purpose
Track estimated vs actual time to improve future estimates and understand project velocity.

## Task Sizing Framework

Use this scale for all future estimates:

| Size | Duration | Icon | Use For |
|------|----------|------|---------|
| **Small** | < 10 minutes | 🟢 | Quick fixes, single file changes, simple updates |
| **Medium** | 10-45 minutes | 🟡 | Component updates, small features, bug fixes |
| **Large** | 45-90 minutes | 🟠 | Full features, multiple file changes, integrations |
| **Extra Large** | > 90 minutes | 🔴 | Major features, architecture changes, refactors |

**Golden Rule:** A "Large" task (45-90 min) is a substantial work session. Plan accordingly!

## Phase 1: Foundation - Error Handling & Observability

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

### Summary

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Size** | 🟠 Large |
| **Estimated Time** | 120 minutes (2 hours) |
| **Actual Time** | **45 minutes** |
| **Variance** | -75 minutes (63% faster!) |
| **Accuracy** | 37.5% |
| **Completion Date** | October 29, 2025 |

### Task Breakdown

| Task | Size | Estimated | Actual | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------|-------|
| 1. Error logs table + RLS | 🟢 Small | 22 min | ~5 min | SQL was pre-written, just paste & run |
| 2. Structured logging utility | 🟡 Medium | 50 min | ~0 min | Pre-written by AI |
| 3. Error Boundaries | 🟡 Medium | 44 min | ~0 min | Pre-written by AI |
| 4. Health check endpoint | 🟡 Medium | 27 min | ~0 min | Pre-written by AI |
| 5. Testing & Integration | 🟡 Medium | 38 min | ~25 min | Manual testing, Google reconnect |
| 6. Documentation review | 🟢 Small | 17 min | ~5 min | Quick scan |
| 7. File copy issues (Mac) | - | 0 min | ~10 min | Unexpected: Mac quarantine |
| **TOTAL** | 🟠 Large | **198 min** | **45 min** | **-153 min variance** |

### Why So Fast?

**Time Savers:**
✅ AI wrote all the code (saved ~120 minutes!)
✅ SQL migration was ready to copy-paste
✅ Clear documentation and checklist
✅ Most time spent on testing (25 min) - as it should be!

**Time Consumers:**
⚠️ Mac file permissions (10 min)
⚠️ Reconnecting Google Calendar (included in testing)

### Lessons Learned

**✅ What Worked:**
1. **Pre-written code**: Having AI write everything saved 2+ hours
2. **Clear instructions**: Step-by-step checklist prevented confusion
3. **SQL ready**: Copy-paste migration was instant
4. **Good testing**: Found and fixed Google token issue

**⚠️ What Took Longer:**
1. Mac file quarantine (unexpected - 10 min)
2. Google Calendar token expired (testing revealed this)

**🎯 Adjustments for Future Estimates:**
1. **With AI assistance**: Reduce coding time by 70-80%
2. **File operations on Mac**: Add 5-10 min buffer
3. **Testing always takes time**: Don't skimp on test estimates
4. **OAuth flows**: Always add time for token refresh issues

---

## Velocity Calculation

After Phase 1, your **velocity** is:

```
Estimated Points: 198 minutes = 3.3 "points"
Actual Time: 45 minutes = 0.75 hours
Velocity: 3.3 / 0.75 = 4.4 points per hour
```

**Translation:** You complete work ~4x faster than raw estimates when AI assists!

**Adjusted Velocity for AI-assisted work:**
- **Pure coding tasks**: 80% faster (AI writes)
- **Integration/testing**: 30% faster (still need to verify)
- **File operations**: Same speed (manual work)

## Notes Section

### Phase 1 Reflection

**What made this so fast?**
1. AI wrote 100% of the code upfront
2. Clear, step-by-step instructions
3. Pre-tested SQL migration
4. Good error messages when issues arose

**What would make it even faster?**
1. Automated file copying (avoid Mac issues)
2. Pre-seeded test database
3. Auto-detect Google token issues

**Surprises:**
- Mac file permissions took 10 min
- Testing was quick (25 min) - good documentation helped
- Health endpoint formatting was bonus work (not in original estimate)

**Key Takeaway:**
With AI assistance, focus estimates on:
- Testing & validation (can't skip this!)
- Integration work (connecting pieces)
- Troubleshooting (unexpected issues)

Coding time is nearly zero with good AI prompts! 🤖
