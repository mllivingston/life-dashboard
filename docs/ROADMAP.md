# Product Roadmap

**Last Updated:** October 30, 2025  
**Current Version:** 1.1.0

---

## Overview

This is the **single source of truth** for what's next in Life Dashboard development. The roadmap is organized into **Technical Improvements** (foundation for scaling) and **User Features** (what users see).

**Quick Links:**
- [Task Sizing Framework](#task-sizing-framework)
- [Current Status](#current-status)
- [Technical Improvements](#technical-improvements-critical-before-scaling)
- [User Features](#user-features)
- [Recommendations](#recommendations)

---

## Task Sizing Framework

Use this scale for all estimates:

| Size | Duration | Icon | Use For |
|------|----------|------|---------|  
| **Small** | < 10 minutes | 🟢 | Quick fixes, single file changes, simple updates |
| **Medium** | 10-45 minutes | 🟡 | Component updates, small features, bug fixes |
| **Large** | 45-90 minutes | 🟠 | Full features, multiple file changes, integrations |
| **Extra Large** | > 90 minutes | 🔴 | Major features, architecture changes, refactors |

**AI-Adjusted Estimates:**
- **Coding tasks:** 70-80% faster (AI writes code)
- **Testing tasks:** 20-30% faster (still manual verification)
- **Integration work:** 40-50% faster (AI helps, you test)
- **File operations:** Same speed (manual work)

**Actual Velocity:** ~4x faster than raw estimates with AI assistance

---

## Current Status

### Completed ✅
- **Phase 1: Foundation** - Error handling & observability (45 min)

### In Progress 🚧
- Deciding between Technical Foundation vs User Features

### Technical Debt Score: 5.2/10 ⚠️

| Category | Score | Gap |
|----------|-------|-----|
| Testing | 1/10 | 🔴 Zero tests |
| Error Handling | 8/10 | 🟢 Solid |
| Security | 5/10 | 🟡 No rate limiting |
| Performance | 4/10 | 🟠 No caching |
| Monitoring | 6/10 | 🟡 Logs exist, no alerts |
| Documentation | 9/10 | 🟢 Excellent |
| Scalability | 3/10 | 🔴 Won't handle 100+ users |
| DevOps | 7/10 | 🟢 Good workflow |
| Data Integrity | 4/10 | 🟠 No validation |

**Overall Assessment:** Good foundation, critical gaps before scaling to real users.

---

## Technical Improvements (Critical Before Scaling)

These are infrastructure and quality improvements that aren't visible to users but are **essential for a production-ready application**.

---

### Phase 2: Technical Foundation 🔴 CRITICAL

**Goal:** Add critical safeguards before any new features  
**Priority:** P0 (Must do before Phase 3+)  
**Why first:** Without these, you're building on quicksand  
**Size:** 🔴 Extra Large  
**Estimated:** ~11 hours (AI-adjusted)

#### What's Missing

**Current reality:**
- ❌ Zero automated tests
- ❌ No input validation (trust all data)
- ❌ No rate limiting (unlimited API calls)
- ❌ No backup plan

**Risk if skipped:**
- 🔥 Can't refactor safely (will break things)
- 🔥 Bad data corrupts database
- 🔥 Attacker can DOS your API ($$$ costs)
- 🔥 Data loss with no recovery

#### Features

**2. Input Validation with Zod** 🟠 Large (~2 hours)

```javascript
// Current code (BAD!)
const { task } = await request.json()
await supabase.from('todos').insert({ task })

// With validation (GOOD!)
import { z } from 'zod'

const TodoSchema = z.object({
  task: z.string()
    .min(1, "Task required")
    .max(500, "Task too long")
    .trim()
})

const validated = TodoSchema.parse(await request.json())
await supabase.from('todos').insert(validated)
```

**Apply to:**

const rateLimit = new Ratelimit({
  redis: Redis.fromEnv(),
  limiter: Ratelimit.slidingWindow(10, "10 s"),
})

const { success } = await rateLimit.limit(userId)
if (!success) {
  return Response.json(
    { error: "Too many requests" }, 
    { status: 429 }
  )
}
```

**Rate limits:**
- API routes: 10 req/10 sec per user

## Recommendations

### Senior Architect's Recommendation 🎯

**If you do ONE thing before building new features:**

👉 **Phase 2: Technical Foundation** (11 hours)

Specifically:
1. **Automated tests** - Can't safely refactor without them
2. **Input validation** - Prevents data corruption
3. **Rate limiting** - Prevents abuse and runaway costs

**Why this matters:**
- Every other feature is risky without tests
- Phase 3 (Resilience) = big refactor = needs tests first
- Can't confidently deploy without tests
- Foundation for everything else

### Recommended Order

**Sprint 1: Critical Foundation (11 hours)**
```
Phase 2: Technical Foundation
└─ Tests, Validation, Rate Limiting
```
**Result:** Can build features safely

**Sprint 2: Make It Reliable (3.5 hours)**
```
Phase 3: Resilience
Phase 5: Monitoring & Alerting
```
**Result:** App doesn't break, you know when it does

**Sprint 3: Choose Your Path**

**Option A: User Value First** (2.5 hours)
```
Phase 4: Multi-Calendar
```
**Result:** Differentiated feature users will love

**Option B: Scaling First** (6 hours)
```
Phase 6: Performance & Scaling
```
**Result:** Can handle 100+ concurrent users

---

## Decision Framework

### When to Work on What

| Priority | Criteria | Time Budget | Example |
|----------|----------|-------------|---------|  
| **P0 (NOW)** | App broken, users blocked | 🔴 XL acceptable | Database down, security breach |
| **P1 (Today)** | Critical for production readiness | 🟠 Large max | Tests, monitoring, resilience |
| **P2 (This Week)** | Important for scale or user value | 🟡 Medium preferred | Multi-calendar, caching |
| **P3 (Later)** | Nice to have | 🟢 Small only | Admin dashboard, analytics |

### Technical vs User Features

**Do Technical First If:**
- ✅ Planning to add more developers
- ✅ Expecting user growth
- ✅ Want to move fast safely
- ✅ Can't afford downtime

**Do User Features First If:**
- ✅ Need to validate product-market fit
- ✅ Solo developer (no one else to break things)
- ✅ Users requesting specific features
- ✅ Competitive pressure

**For Your App:**
Technical foundation first. You're at 5.2/10 technical debt score. Get to 7+/10 before adding features.

## What's Next?

### Immediate Decision Point

**You need to choose:**

### Option 1: Technical Foundation First (RECOMMENDED) ✅

**Path:**
```
1. Phase 2: Technical Foundation (11 hours)
2. Phase 3: Resilience (2 hours)
3. Phase 5: Alerting (1.5 hours)
4. Then: User features OR performance
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Safe to refactor and add features
- ✅ Can onboard developers
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Sleep at night

**Cons:**
- ❌ No new user-visible features for 14 hours
- ❌ Feels like "not making progress"
- ❌ Hard to demo

**Best for:** Professional product, planning to scale, multiple developers

---

### Option 2: User Features First ⚠️

**Path:**
```
1. Phase 4: Multi-Calendar (2.5 hours)
2. [Other user features]
3. Eventually: Technical debt (14+ hours)
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Visible progress immediately
- ✅ Easy to demo
- ✅ User value faster

**Cons:**
- ❌ Building on shaky foundation
- ❌ Harder to fix later (more code to test)
- ❌ Risk of breaking things
- ❌ Can't scale safely

**Best for:** MVP validation, solo developer, no time pressure

---

### The Brutal Truth

**Current state:** You have a prototype that works for 1 user (you).  
**To get to:** Production app for 100+ users...  
**You need:** Technical foundation.

**The math:**
- Skip tests now: Save 8 hours
- First production bug without tests: Spend 10+ hours debugging
- Second bug: Another 10+ hours
- **Total: Lost 12+ hours, still need to add tests**

**Better approach:**
- Do tests first: Spend 8 hours
- Each bug: Caught by tests, fixed in 30 min
- **Total: Saved time + better app**

---

## My Recommendation

**As a senior architect, here's what I'd do:**

**Week 1:** Phase 2 (Technical Foundation)  
**Week 2:** Phase 3 (Resilience) + Phase 5 (Alerting)  
**Week 3:** Phase 4 (Multi-Calendar) - First user feature!  
**Week 4:** Phase 6 (Performance) or more user features  

**By end of Week 2:** You have a professional, production-ready app  
**By end of Week 3:** You have a professional app with cool features  

**You'll thank yourself later.** 🙏
